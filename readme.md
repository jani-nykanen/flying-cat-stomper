A game being made for [Gopher Jam](https://itch.io/jam/gopher-jam)

(More info coming to this page later)

**NOTE:** This code is really bad. I'm not a Go programmer, I'm a C programmer, and that probably shows in my code very clearly.

Build instructions:

1) Install SDL2: https://github.com/veandco/go-sdl2
2) Go to the directory and type `go build`
3) That's it!
